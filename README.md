# Skylark-Drones
It is an interactive map-based visualization website which shows real time occurrence of earthquakes over a period of 7 days(4 August'18-10 August'18) with magnitude gradation.
The .geojson file is extracted from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ . 
The user can zoom in and zoom out to view different locations and can click on the epicentre to view information about the geographic point.  Navigation controls are added for better user interaction.
The user can also filter events based on the time of the day.
A modal is added at the bottom of the map which is triggered by an on click button, hence making it user-friendly.
